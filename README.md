Hello! I'm **Aziz**, a **Front-End Developer** passionate about **Angular**, scalable architectures, and secure API integrations.  
With a strong foundation in **standalone components, lazy loading, dependency injection**, and **SSR compatibility**, I craft efficient, maintainable applications that enhance user experience.  

While **Angular** is my primary expertise, my **advanced knowledge of JavaScript and TypeScript** allows me to explore other frameworks like **Next.js, NestJS, and Laravel**, ensuring adaptability across technologies.  
My workflow integrates **frontend efficiency, backend security**, and structured **API optimizations** to create high-performance applications.  

##  Deliverables & Work  
✅ **Angular-Based Web Applications** – Dynamic, scalable solutions using **PrimeNG** and **DaisyUI**.  
✅ **Secure API Integrations** – Managing **CORS, CSRF**, and **cookie-based authentication** for reliable cross-platform interactions.  
✅ **Performance-Oriented UI/UX** – Creating **modular UI components** with a focus on efficiency and maintainability.  
✅ **Backend Connectivity & Environment-Based Configurations** – Ensuring seamless **API handling** while securing sensitive data.  
✅ **Expanding Beyond Angular** – Leveraging **JavaScript and TypeScript expertise** to integrate **Next.js, NestJS, Laravel**, and beyond.  

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies I Use  
⚙ **Frameworks & Libraries:** Angular, Next.js, NestJS, Laravel, NativePHP  
🎨 **UI Components:** PrimeNG, DaisyUI  
🔒 **Authentication & Security:** CSRF, CORS, Cookie-Based Authentication  
📈 **Development & Optimization:** TypeScript, RxJS, Angular Services  
🔗 **Scalability & Maintainability:** Environment-based configurations, reusable utilities, SSR compatibility  

## 🏆 My Approach  
I take pride in building **scalable, secure, and efficient applications**, ensuring seamless integration between **frontend and backend** while maintaining **clean architecture, reusable utilities, and structured API strategies** for maintainable and future-proof solutions.
